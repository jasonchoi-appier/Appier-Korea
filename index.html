        <h2>About.</h2>
        <p>
            Relocating from Pennsylvania to New York City in 1997, Thom Browne worked in the Giorgio Armani showroom and creative department of Club Monaco before launching his eponymous label in 2001. Believing that the modern ubiquity of casual dress lends the wearing of suits a subversive edge, Browne established impeccably tailored suits in traditional wools and flannels as his signature specialty. Initially shocking to the fashion world, his designs have placed him at the vanguard of directional formalwear. Applying a similar approach, the label's fragrance collections feature time-honored warm scents like whiskey alongside sharp florals and citrus notes, providing both softness and vigor. Though drawing inspiration from classic American style, Thom Browne brings a refreshing contemporary refinement to his labelâ€™s growing range of ready-to-wear, accessories, and fragrances.
